# autodir

This tool is a Python-based directory discovery tool for websites that takes a different approach from the traditional method of using wordlists. Instead of relying on a pre-existing wordlist, this tool dynamically generates potential directory names and tests them in real-time. This approach eliminates the need to store large wordlists in memory and allows for more efficient and flexible discovery of directories.
